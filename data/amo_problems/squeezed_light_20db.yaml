background_context: |
  Squeezed light represents one of the most important non-classical states of light,
  enabling quantum-enhanced sensing beyond the standard quantum limit. 20 dB squeezing
  would enable revolutionary improvements in gravitational wave detection, quantum sensing,
  and quantum information processing.
  
  Current limitations:
  - Technical noise sources limiting achieved squeezing
  - Optical losses degrading squeezing during propagation  
  - Bandwidth limitations in current squeezing sources
  - Detection inefficiencies

experimental_constraints:
  - "Squeezing must be verified by homodyne detection"
  - "System must operate at room temperature"
  - "Continuous wave operation preferred"
  - "Compatible with existing gravitational wave detectors"

theoretical_framework: |
  Parametric amplification below threshold:
  Squeezing parameter: r = asinh(√(P_pump/P_threshold - 1))
  Noise reduction: ΔX₁² = (1/4)exp(-2r)
  Squeezing in dB: S = -10 log₁₀(ΔX₁²/(1/4))
  
  Fundamental limit: Perfect squeezing limited by spontaneous parametric scattering
