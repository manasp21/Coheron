background_context: |
  Quantum memory is essential for quantum networks, quantum repeaters, and distributed 
  quantum computing. Current systems struggle to achieve both high fidelity and long 
  storage times simultaneously due to decoherence mechanisms.
  
  Key challenges:
  - Environmental decoherence limiting storage times
  - Imperfect state transfer efficiency
  - Noise accumulation during storage
  - Technical limitations in control systems

experimental_constraints:
  - "Memory must work with arbitrary quantum states"
  - "On-demand retrieval capability required"
  - "System must be scalable to multiple memory cells"
  - "Compatible with telecommunication wavelengths preferred"

theoretical_framework: |
  Total fidelity F_total = F_storage × F_retrieval × exp(-t/T_coherence)
  
  For quantum networks: F_total > 99% required for useful entanglement distribution
  Storage time must exceed network communication delays (~ms)
