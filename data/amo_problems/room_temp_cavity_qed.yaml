background_context: |
  Current cavity QED experiments demonstrating strong coupling require cryogenic cooling 
  to suppress thermal noise and maintain coherence. Room temperature operation would 
  revolutionize quantum technologies by eliminating complex cooling systems.
  
  Key challenges include:
  - Thermal motion destroying atom-cavity alignment
  - Thermal photons competing with quantum effects  
  - Increased decoherence rates at higher temperatures
  - Material limitations in high-Q cavities at 300K

experimental_constraints:
  - "No cryogenic cooling systems allowed"
  - "Single atom control and positioning required"
  - "Cavity must maintain alignment despite thermal fluctuations"
  - "Detection must distinguish quantum from thermal effects"

theoretical_framework: |
  Strong coupling occurs when g > (κ,γ)/2 where:
  - g: vacuum Rabi coupling strength
  - κ: cavity decay rate  
  - γ: atomic spontaneous decay rate
  
  At room temperature, thermal effects introduce additional decoherence.
