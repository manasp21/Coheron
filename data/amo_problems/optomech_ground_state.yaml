background_context: |
  Ground state cooling of macroscopic oscillators would demonstrate quantum effects
  at the boundary between classical and quantum worlds. Current achievements are
  limited to very small oscillators. Scaling to larger masses while maintaining
  ground state cooling would enable tests of quantum mechanics at macroscopic scales.
  
  Key challenges:
  - Thermal decoherence scales with mass
  - Lower mechanical frequencies for larger oscillators
  - Maintaining high mechanical quality factors
  - Achieving sufficient optomechanical coupling

experimental_constraints:
  - "Mechanical oscillator must be suspended or levitated"
  - "Optical cavity must maintain high finesse"
  - "System must operate in resolved sideband regime"
  - "Measurement must verify quantum ground state"

theoretical_framework: |
  Resolved sideband cooling:
  Final phonon number: n̄_f = (Γ_heating)/(Γ_cooling + Γ_heating)
  
  Cooling rate: Γ_cooling = 4g²n̄_cav/κ
  Heating rate: Γ_heating = γ_m n̄_th
  
  Ground state condition: n̄_f << 1 requires Γ_cooling >> Γ_heating
