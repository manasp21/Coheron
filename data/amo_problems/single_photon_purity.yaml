background_context: |
  Deterministic single photon sources are essential for linear optical quantum computing,
  quantum communication, and quantum sensing. Current sources face trade-offs between
  purity, brightness, and indistinguishability. Achieving all parameters simultaneously
  would enable practical quantum photonic technologies.
  
  Key challenges:
  - Spectral diffusion reducing indistinguishability
  - Collection efficiency limited by solid-state environments
  - Trade-off between brightness and purity
  - Environmental fluctuations affecting stability

experimental_constraints:
  - "Must operate at telecommunication wavelengths or be convertible"
  - "Room temperature operation preferred"
  - "Electrical triggering capability required"
  - "Compatible with standard optical components"

theoretical_framework: |
  Single photon statistics:
  g²(τ) = ⟨n(t)n(t+τ)⟩/⟨n(t)⟩²
  
  Perfect single photon: g²(0) = 0
  Multi-photon suppression: P_multi = g²(0) × P_emission
  
  Hong-Ou-Mandel visibility: V = (I_max - I_min)/(I_max + I_min)
